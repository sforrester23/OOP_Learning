## Definitions

### Class()
A Class is an essential part of OOP. Classes are a collection of methods and act like a cookie cutters for constructing objects/instances 

### (self)
(self) refers to the instance on which the method is being called

### Instance of a Class
A specific occurrence or example of a class

### Methods
Are functions that can be used by/on objects of a specific class 

### Abstractions
Abstraction is hiding complexity from the user and exposing only useful/necessary parts to get something done.

An example would be turning on a microwave using the start button. We don't need to know about the particle vibrations and resonance - we just need to know our food will be warm.

### Inheritance 
The ability to inherit behaviours and characteristics from a parent class.
